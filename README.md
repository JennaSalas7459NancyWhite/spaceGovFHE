# Space Governance FHE: A Secure Voting System for Interplanetary Democracy üöÄ

Space Governance FHE is an innovative voting system designed specifically for future space colonies and interplanetary societies. This project harnesses **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, ensuring that citizens' votes are securely encrypted from end to end‚Äîwhether they are on Earth, the Moon, or Mars. By prioritizing privacy and security, we lay the groundwork for democratic governance in the cosmos.

## The Challenge of Interplanetary Voting üåå

As humanity ventures further into space, establishing a reliable and secure voting mechanism becomes paramount. The fragmented and remote nature of interplanetary governance presents significant challenges. Traditional voting systems are often vulnerable to manipulation, disenfranchisement, and privacy breaches. Citizens need a way to cast their votes with certainty that their choices are protected and anonymous, regardless of their location in the solar system. 

## How Zama's FHE Provides a Solution üîê

The Space Governance FHE project addresses these challenges by utilizing **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**. By encrypting votes using Zama's open-source libraries‚Äîsuch as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, we ensure that votes remain confidential throughout the entire voting process. This means that even the system processing the votes cannot access the actual votes, thereby safeguarding voter privacy while guaranteeing transparency. 

This revolutionary approach allows us to implement a governance system that ensures integrity and trust for interplanetary citizens. Votes can be processed without decryption, which is essential for maintaining the secrecy of ballots in any electoral scenario. 

## Core Features üõ†Ô∏è

- **End-to-End Encryption:** All votes are encrypted from the moment they are cast until they are publicly revealed.
- **Interplanetary Voting Compatibility:** Designed to work across various celestial bodies, ensuring inclusivity for all potential inhabitants of space.
- **User-Friendly Voting Interface:** A simple and intuitive interface for users to cast their votes easily, regardless of their technical expertise.
- **Transparent Results:** The voting results can be publicly verified while maintaining the privacy of each voter.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Capable of handling an increasing number of participants as human presence expands throughout the solar system.

## Technology Stack üñ•Ô∏è

- **Zama FHE SDK**: Central to our confidential computing approach and voter privacy.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract language for implementing the voting system.
- **Node.js**: For building the backend and interacting with smart contracts.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment for Ethereum applications.
- **React**: For building a responsive and user-friendly front end.

## Directory Structure üìÅ

Here‚Äôs a snapshot of the project's directory layout to help you navigate:

```
/spaceGovFHE
|-- contracts
|   |-- spaceGovFHE.sol
|-- scripts
|-- test
|-- .env
|-- package.json
|-- hardhat.config.js
```

## Installation Instructions ‚öôÔ∏è

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and Hardhat installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Download the Project Files**: Do not use `git clone` or any URLs. Instead, obtain the project files through appropriate means.
2. **Navigate to the project directory** in your command line interface.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the necessary libraries, including those from Zama:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory if it does not exist, and input your configuration details.

## Build and Run the Project üèóÔ∏è

To compile the smart contracts, run:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

To test the contracts, execute:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

And finally, to launch the application, use:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network yourNetwork
```

Replace `yourNetwork` with the actual network you are targeting (next-gen interplanetary network, perhaps?).

## Example Code Snippet üíª

Here's a simple code snippet demonstrating how to cast a vote securely:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./spaceGovFHE.sol";

contract Voting {
    function castVote(bytes memory encryptedVote) public {
        // Logic to store the encrypted vote 
    }

    function revealResults() public view returns (bytes memory) {
        // Logic to reveal the results while maintaining privacy
    }
}
```

## Acknowledgements üôè

Powered by the groundbreaking work of the **Zama team**, we extend our heartfelt gratitude for their pioneering technological contributions. Their open-source tools have made it possible to design confidential blockchain applications, enabling us to secure the future of governance in space. Together, we strive to create a democratic framework for humanity's expansion into the cosmos.
